# Customer Personality Analysis

In this task, I imported a raw dataset into Python and performed essential data-cleaning steps to make it ready for analysis. I used Pandas to check the data structure, remove null values, drop duplicates, and handle missing data. This process helped me transform an unorganized dataset into a clean and reliable one. Through this task, I learned how important data cleaning is and how it improves the accuracy and quality of any analysis.
